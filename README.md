# Intui-son
Dematerialized musical instrument using the Kinect technology

Because learning a musical instrument may be long and painful, and so frustrating, we decided to develop an "intuitive" instrument, allowing people from every musical background to play music without completing any course of theoretical instruction.
Thus, the Intui'Son device is a dematerialized instrument using the Kinect technology. The musical play is made possible by the detection and identification of the movements of the user's hands. The device was developed with the programming language PROCESSING, well-known in artistic field.

Here is a list of features we managed to implement over the past three months:
- defining the instrument configuration
- selecting instrumental sounds, including the violin, the accordion, the trumpet, the piano and the guitar
- playing notes simultaneously
- playing specific chords (major and minor)
- defining the modulation of the pitch
- defining the velocity modulation
